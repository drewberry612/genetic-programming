# Genetic Algorithms and Symbolic Regression

This project implements **multiple genetic algorithms** and **symbolic regression** in **Python**. The focus was on using genetic algorithms to optimise solutions and apply symbolic regression to model and discover mathematical relationships from data.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Genetic Algorithms**: Used to solve optimisation problems by mimicking the process of natural selection.
- **Symbolic Regression**: Applied to discover mathematical expressions that best fit given data.

This repository contains the code for multiple experiments with these techniques.
